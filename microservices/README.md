# Microservices
- Microservices are an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network.
- Instead of building a monolithic application where all the functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services.
- More the microservices, more is the frequency of the deployments.
- Microservices that need to communicate with each other can be linked to each other (using --link) or both can be placed inside the same network.

## Docker Compose
- This tool should be used to launch microservices instead of docker.
- Docker Compose relies on Docker Engine for any meaningful work.
